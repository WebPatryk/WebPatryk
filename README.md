### Hi I'm Patric 👋👱

<br />

I'm 20-year-old graduate of a technical college in Computer Science. For 2 years I have been interested in programming, especially frontend development. I learned mainly at home from various courses on Udemy. I created my own portfolio, which I develop all the time with new projects. I love programming in React because you can create both small and big projects in a simple way.
